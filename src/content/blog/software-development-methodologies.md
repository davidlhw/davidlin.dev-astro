A software development methodology comprises a set of guidelines, instruments, and methods used in project
planning, execution, and management. Software development techniques support team engagement by assisting
project managers in leading team members and monitoring work. A few popular methodologies are discussed below.

### Waterfall

This consists of a sequential process that is continuous similar to a waterfall having several phases, each
requiring a completed state before moving on to the next. Every phase is dependent on inputs from the level
before it and includes its respective requirements. No two phases overlap under any circumstance.

For instance, a software development project goes through the following stages of the waterfall approach.

1. The **requirements** of the project include costs, functions, expectations, risks, and the deadline.
2. Focus on **research**, logical design, and architecture.
3. **Start coding** based on the specifications and eventually start the implementation along with certain
   testing.
4. **Verification/testing.** Rigorous testing process before the public release to ensure a smooth UI and
   bug-free product.
5. **Deployment/maintenance.** The public release of the software is followed by maintenance.

### Lean

Lean project management optimizes customer value and reduces waste by streamlining the movement of resources or
activities across the entire system. Lean project managers are responsible for locating bottlenecks and
constraints. The aim is to create a reliable system with higher productivity and a reduced total cost. This
boosts collaborative teamwork.

There are five key principles and each develops on the one before it, creating a cycle that enables ongoing
process modification and enhancement.

1. **Determine value.** Value cannot be easily defined since it varies with client expectations. Stakeholders
   should be studied.
2. **Value Stream Mapping (VSM).** A visual technique that entails mapping out both your actual and ideal
   workflows for a project from the beginning to the end.
3. **Make a flow.** By eliminating the waste found in the previous step, the project management strategy should
   be redesigned to be more effective.
4. **Create pull.** When the pull is established, work is taken from the preceding step as it is finished.
5. **Strive for excellence.** Entail looking back on earlier projects, finding weak spots, and developing fresh
   approaches to test later.

### Agile

Agile development emerged as a result of discontent with the excessive delays associated with more conventional
development methods, such as Waterfall. Instead of heavily planned, unsteady product launches or updates, this
emphasizes continual, gradual improvement and response to consumer needs.

Two common development variations based on Agile principles are Scrum and Kanban.

### Scrum

takes the position of sprints, which are tasks that teams must do in practical time frames. Teams give input on
the progress, challenges, and a strategy for overcoming those challenges during daily meetings that help teams
complete each assignment. Each sprint is concluded with a retrospective meeting to review the results.

This approach has distinct responsibilities that help set up expectations and enable the scrum team to work more
effectively. These scrum positions are Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developer.

1. **Scrum Master.** Assists a scrum team to adhere to tenets and the scrum process. They also facilitate
   meetings and reduce any barriers to productivity.
2. **Product owner.** Ensure that procedure is used on the appropriate job at the appropriate time. Stakeholders
   are always in contact.
3. **Every team member** is a developer except those who hold the other two positions.

### Kanban

Kanban emphasizes workflow optimization in contrast to other approaches that focus on the repetitive nature of
project operations. Instead of embarking on massive workloads that are impossible to complete, a Kanban
visualization board encourages team members to think about how their workflow may be enhanced within realistic
time constraints. The visualization stage allows team members to assess the workflow and identify areas for
future development.

Following are the fundamentals of Kanban.

1. **Kanban Board.** This is a visual representation of a project’s status.
2. **Work in progress (WIP) limits.** These are restrictions that stop work from progressing to the succeeding
   stage if it causes a bottleneck.
3. **Meeting cadences.** There is no predetermined timeframe for Kanban. Instead, every meeting that the team
   utilizes is scheduled by the Kanban team.

### Project Management Triangle

This represents the requirement to control the three constraints (variables) - scope, cost, and time. This is
necessary to ensure 'quality' output.

It is the responsibility of the project manager to strike a balance between these three variables to maintain
the project's expense, timeline, and scope. The project’s quality may deteriorate if one variable is shifted
without modifying the other variable, or both of them.

- **Scope:** Determines a project’s expanse in terms of the level of information, scope, and size of its
  deliverables. The project will take longer and cost more to finish as its size grows.
- **Cost:** Implies the financial side including money, employee wages, and all expenses incurred throughout the
  timespan.
- **Time:** Project time includes the time and types of time such as extending deadlines, adjusting planning
  phases, and so on.

### Recap

There are numerous software development methods, and to determine the best, they should be understood since some
of them perform better in specific industries and projects.

The project management triangle is a crucial concept to follow and it is the project manager’s responsibility to
strike a balance between the triangle's trinity for quality to produce the best work while complying with the
project's criteria, budget, and timeline.
